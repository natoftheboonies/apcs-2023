# Unit 10, Lesson 03: Recursion: Let's take a hike!

## Warm-up: Exponents

Create a static function to calculate _a<sup>b</sup>_ without using `Math.pow`.

Here is an iterative solution to copy-paste, or write your own.

```java
static int power(int a, int b) {
    int result = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < b; i++) {
        result *= a;
    }
    return result;
}
```

Add a `main` method to check (via printing out) that `power(2,12)` returns `4096`.

Next, write the recursive version. For a base case, recall that _a<sup>1</sup>_ = _a_.

## Objectives

By the end of today's lesson, you should:

- Be familiar with divide-and-conquer as it relates to recursion.
- Be familiar with trees, graphs and parts (nodes and edges).
- Understand how recursion can help in real-world programming solutions.
- Recognize that we can model things beyond what you might expect.
- Recognize that you are also learning [21st Century Skills](https://www.k12.wa.us/student-success/career-technical-education-cte/cte-resources-essentials/21st-century-skills).

## Lesson

### Divide and conquer

- Note the similarities between recursive and iterative exponent calculation. It is still making the computer do more work.
- See how the recursive function can be improved by using divide-and-conquer strategy: `power(a,n) = power(a,n/2)*power(a,n/2)` vs. `= a*power(a, n-1)` and the variation if n is odd.
  - Now is it less work for the computer? We could also write this iteratively. 🤷

### Trees and Graphs

- Trees are not on the exam. But they're cool, and well suited to recursion.
- Tree data structure. Nodes (Vertices), Children, Data. Edges.
- Root vs Leaves. Tree vs. Graph
- Arrays and Strings as linear Trees

### Exploring a Tree through Recursion

Trees are one place where recursion really shines. (The other is Compiler design, as compilers parse the code you write to an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), but this is for a later CS course.)

- Let's code a tree `class node {string data, list<node> children}`
  - Open up Baum.java ("Baum" is German for "Tree")
  - Using `filesystemTree` as an example, code your own tree (family tree, an object model, another filesystem, whatever is on your mind) and return the root.
- While you do that, I'll help whoever needs to finish their GitHub/IDE.
- Let's recursively traverse a tree and print the nodes:
  - preorder (my data first),
  - postorder (my data last),
  - inorder (when binary tree, my data in the middle)
- code together: max depth of a tree

### Anacortes Community Forest Lands

There are opportunities for applying technology to solve problems beyond the obvious. Let's start building "Google Maps" for our [community forest lands](https://www.friendsoftheacfl.org/maps)

Do you have Visual Studio Code yet? If so, [lab01-acfl](lab01-acfl/) should "just work"

### Data Serialization

[Data Serialization](https://devopedia.org/data-serialization) is the process of converting data objects to a written-down format that computers can understand.

- Text file
- [CSV](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-to-open-the-csv-file-format/) and spreadsheets
- [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/) and HTML
- [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) - JavaScript Object Notation [JavaScript reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON)
- [YAML](https://yaml.org/) - YAML Ain't Markup Language™

### Exploring a trail map with recursion

Let's return to [Heart lake](https://www.friendsoftheacfl.org/maps). See how it has a grid like a spreadsheet? We can interpret this map as a set of trail segments and junctions.

- a junction needs a name, and has trails leading out from it.
- a segment has a trail, a distance, and is between 2 junctions.

How might we encode this map?

- trails.yaml
- edges.yml

And then let's deserialize it into Java!

### HOWTO commit code

- [Git is hard](https://medium.com/upperlinecode/how-to-teach-git-commits-github-to-teenagers-a3f740b2f500).
- Visual Studio Code has a handy "Source Control" tab.

## Sponge

Free time? Let's encode a few [cranberry lake trails](https://www.friendsoftheacfl.org/maps) as [YAML](https://yaml.org/). I want to assign this as homework, Divide and Conquer!, but my teacher-teacher told me not to. So, you're off the hook. (For now...)

```yaml
- trail: 126
  nodes:
    - I15
    - H14
  distance: .25
- trail: 126
  nodes:
    - I15
    - J16
  distance: .30
```
